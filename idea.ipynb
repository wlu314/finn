    "\n",
    "Below is a brief overview of each order type, what it does, and when it might be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Market Order\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Buy or sell immediately at the best available (current market) price.\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - Fills as quickly as possible, regardless of price movements.\n",
    "  - Typically used when you want immediate execution.\n",
    "  - May suffer from slippage in fast-moving or illiquid markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Limit Order\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Buy or sell at a specified “limit” price or better.\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - If you set a buy limit, the order will only fill if the market price is at or below your limit.\n",
    "  - If you set a sell limit, the order will only fill if the market price is at or above your limit.\n",
    "  - You won’t pay more (for a buy) or receive less (for a sell) than your limit price.\n",
    "  - Risk: The order may never fill if the market does not reach your limit price.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Stop (Stop Market) Order\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Convert into a market order once a specific “stop price” is reached or exceeded.\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - A buy stop is placed **above** the current market price and triggers a market buy when the stop level is reached.\n",
    "  - A sell stop is placed **below** the current market price and triggers a market sell when the stop level is reached.\n",
    "  - Often used as a **stop-loss**: If the price drops to your stop (sell stop) or rises to your stop (buy stop), it protects against further losses.\n",
    "  - Fills at the best available market price once triggered, which can vary from the stop price in fast-moving markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Stop Limit Order\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Convert into a **limit order** once a specific stop price is reached.\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - Combines the features of a stop and a limit order.\n",
    "  - Once the stop price is triggered, the order will only be filled at your set limit price (or better).\n",
    "  - Advantage: It removes the uncertainty of a market order fill price.\n",
    "  - Risk: If the market moves quickly past your limit price (slippage), your order may go unfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Trailing Stop Order\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Automatically adjust your stop price as the market moves in your favor.\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - The stop price will “trail” the market by a set amount (e.g., \\$1 below current price) or percentage (e.g., 5% below current price).\n",
    "  - As the price moves in your favor, the trailing stop updates to lock in more profit.\n",
    "  - If the price reverses by the trail amount/percentage, it triggers a market order to close the position.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Bracket (BRACKET) Order\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Enter a position (buy or sell) with **automatic exit orders** for both a profit target and a stop loss.\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - **One main (primary) order** (Market or Limit) to open the position.\n",
    "  - **Two attached exit orders**:\n",
    "    1. A **take-profit** (limit sell if you bought, or limit buy if you shorted).\n",
    "    2. A **stop-loss** (stop or stop limit).\n",
    "  - When one exit order is triggered, the other is canceled automatically.\n",
    "  - Useful for trade management: automatically sets both your risk limit (stop loss) and profit-taking level.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. OTO (One-Triggers-Other)\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Place a primary order that, when filled, **automatically triggers** another (secondary) order.\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - The secondary order is typically a stop loss or take-profit order that only becomes active if the first order executes.\n",
    "  - Used to automate setting your exit plans once the entry order fills.\n",
    "  - If the first order never executes, the secondary order remains dormant (and effectively never enters the market).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. OCO (One-Cancels-Other)\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Place **two orders** (often a stop and a limit) so that **if one is filled, the other is automatically canceled**.\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - Typically used to bracket a position around current prices without a single \"master\" entry (unlike a bracket order which has one entry and two exits).\n",
    "  - For example, you might place a stop order below the market and a limit order above the market. Whichever triggers first cancels the other.\n",
    "  - Helps traders looking to catch breakouts in either direction or secure a certain price while protecting against an adverse move.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "1. **Market Orders:** Speed and certainty of fill, but uncertain fill price (slippage possible).\n",
    "2. **Limit Orders:** Control over the execution price but uncertain if/when the order will fill.\n",
    "3. **Stop/Stop Limit Orders:** Typically used for stop-loss protection or breakout trades.\n",
    "4. **Trailing Stop Orders:** Automatically update the stop to protect profits as price moves favorably.\n",
    "5. **Bracket Orders:** Automate both profit-taking and stop-loss in a single setup (ideal for set-and-forget strategies).\n",
    "6. **OTO Orders:** Execute one order, which then triggers another—ideal for chaining an entry and exit plan.\n",
    "7. **OCO Orders:** Two orders, one cancels the other—often used to trap a potential breakout or limit risk in multiple scenarios.\n",
